# Make-Primers (Molecular Biology)
This includes a function for calculating primer melting temperature or Tm (simplistic formula where each G or C increases 4 degrees and each A or C increases by 2 degrees).
A second function for finding primers for qPCR by giving the estimated Tm and its location in the gene as qPCR usually requires products of a specific size.
